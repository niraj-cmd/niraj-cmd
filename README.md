# üë®‚Äçüíª Niraj | Red Team Enthusiast & Ethical Hacker

Hi! I'm **Niraj Ashtaputre**, and I'm passionate about cybersecurity ‚Äî especially the offensive side like red teaming and ethical hacking.

I love building tools that help simulate real-world attacks in a safe way. I‚Äôve created open-source projects like:
- üîç **SilentSniffer** ‚Äì A tool for quietly monitoring network activity  
- üîê **GhostAccess** ‚Äì A simple lab and scripts to learn privilege escalation  
- üõ†Ô∏è **BackdoorBox** ‚Äì A toolkit that shows how attackers maintain access (in a controlled lab environment)

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools
- Python, Bash, Netcat, Scapy, Crontab, Reverse Shells
- Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Burp Suite, VirtualBox
- Red Team, Privilege Escalation, Post-Exploitation

üìö Always learning. Open to CTFs, collabs, and community hacking!
